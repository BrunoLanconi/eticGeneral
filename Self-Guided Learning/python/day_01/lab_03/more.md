# Google Colab and Jupyter

Google Colab and Jupyter are both popular tools for interactive programming and data analysis. While Google Colab is a cloud-based platform, Jupyter can be run locally on your machine. However, with the help of VS Code, you can now use Jupyter on your local development environment as well.

Google Colab is a free cloud-based platform that provides a Jupyter notebook environment. It allows you to write and execute Python code, create visualizations, and perform data analysis. One of the key advantages of Google Colab is that it provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, which can significantly speed up your computations.

To use Google Colab, you simply need a web browser and a Google account. You can create and share notebooks, collaborate with others in real-time, and even run code on Google's powerful infrastructure. It also supports various libraries and frameworks, making it a versatile tool for machine learning and data science projects.

## [Jupyter on VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)

VS Code is a popular code editor that provides a rich set of features for software development. With the Jupyter extension for VS Code, you can now run Jupyter notebooks directly within the editor. This allows you to leverage the power of Jupyter while enjoying the familiar interface and productivity features of VS Code.

To use Jupyter on VS Code, you need to install the Jupyter extension from the VS Code marketplace. Once installed, you can create, open, and edit Jupyter notebooks just like any other file in VS Code. The extension provides features such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and cell execution, making it a convenient choice for Jupyter users.

## [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install#jupyter-notebook)

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used for data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and statistical modeling. Jupyter Notebook supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia.
