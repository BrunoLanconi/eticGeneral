# Example 4: Using Stylesheets

The styleSheets property on the document object returns a list of the stylesheets that have been loaded on that document. You can access these stylesheets and their rules individually using the stylesheet, style, and CSSRule objects, as demonstrated in this example, which prints out all of the style rule selectors to the console.
